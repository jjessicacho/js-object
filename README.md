# js-object
I created a deck of cards using JavaScript Objects.
- Part 1:
    - Define a Card object using constructor function
    - Instantiate a card object and display the value returned by the describeSelf() function
- Part 2:
    - Define Deck object functions using Class function
    - Invoke and display Deck object functions
- Part 3:
    - Define a Player object
    - Instantiate two Player Objects and deal five cards to each
    - Display to the browser the contents of each player's hand

## What I need to fix:
- How to use forEach loop to list out the cards in the third part??
